# Basics-of-Java-OOPs

**Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems
– by James Gosling
– released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems
– Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

**Features of Java:
1) Object Oriented
2) Platform independent:
3) Simple
4) Portable
5) Architectural- neutral
6) Robust
7) Interpreted
8) High Performance:
9) Secure

**Java programs normally undergo four phases:
1)Edit
2)Compile
3)Load
4)Execute

**Java Program Lifecycle:
In this the file we save and compile is converted into .class file internally and JVM converts this .class file into bits and execution is carried out. The ouput of this program will be displayed on the screen.

**Object Oriented Programming:**

• Encapsulation
• Abstraction
• Polymorphism
• Inheritance

1)**Encapsulation**:
  It hides the irrelevant information from the user like details of implementation of a class and it makes code more maintainable.
  
2) **Abstraction**:
   Abstraction means to it shows only the necessary details to the client of the object.
    – Public methods
    – Perspective based

3)**Access Specifiers**:
  It specifies the type of the Specifiers. Types include public, private, protected & default.
  
4) **Inheritance**:
   Inheritance is a property of accquiring methods, varibales and properties of a base(Parent) class by child(Sub) class.
   It is implemented by the keyword "extends".
   Inheritance is of different types. some of them are:
      1) Single Inheritance
      2) Multilevel Inheritance
      3) Hierarachial Inheritance

5) **Polymorphism**:
   Polymorphism means taking multiple forms. This polymorphism is of two types:
      1)Compile time polymorphism
      2)Runtime polymorphism


***Primitive Data Types:***

1)Logical -Boolean : The boolean data type has two literals, true andfalse.

2)Textual –char : It represents a 16-bit unicode character and must have literals enclosed in a single quotes('').

3)Integral –byte, short, int, long :
      Integral primates use three forms: Decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
      Literals have a default type of int.
      Literals with the suffix L or l are of type long.
      (i) byte:
              – Byte data type is a 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
      (ii) short:
              – Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer.
      (iii) int:
              – Int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.
       (iv) long:
              - Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer.
       (v) float:
              – Float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
       (vi) double:
              – double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
       (vii) char:
              – char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.
